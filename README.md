## Description

This full-stack application sought out to create a forum specifically for memes. We thought it would be the reddit of memes. Just good memes
without the fluff or questionable comments and Keep posts short and concise with little to no room for drama, keeping things silly and entertaining.

The application allow users to create and edit profile, post meme on their page, comment to other users post as well as edit and delete their own post. In future users will be able to like and dislike meme posts, get notifications, create AI-generated meme, send and receive messages. User must create account to see other users post, comment and to post a meme. User authentication will be via session storage.

## Overview

- The Challenge:
  When we came up with the concept of Memebook we wanted to keep the app simple to use therefore we wanted to use the simplest tools
  that could carry out the task with ease. The challenge came when we tried to merge our code together. Being students, we had conflicting ideas about
  certain tasks, features, etc. and had to come to an agreement in a timely manner. Only having a limited amount of time to work on this and a holiday break in the middle
  of it did not help either. All in all, we kept our heads down and coded our way through it all. We're excited about what Memebook is and the potential it holds.
