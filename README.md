    With Memebook we sought out to create a forum specifically for memes. We thought it would be the reddit of memes. Just good memes
    without the fluff or questionable comments.

Overview
    The Challenge:
    When we came up with the concept of Memebook we wanted to keep the app simple to use therefore we wanted to use the simplest tools
    that could carry out the task with ease. The challenge came when we tried to merge our code together. Being students, we had conflicting ideas about 
    certain tasks, features, etc. and had to come to an agreement in a timely manner. Only having a limited amount of time to work on this and a holiday break in the middle
    of it did not help either. All in all, we kept our heads down and coded our way through it all. We're excited about what Memebook is and the potential it holds.

    Built with:
        We used Heroku as our deployment app. We did try to use inovative APIs such as 'Pusher' but this is currently still a work in progress.
        For our front-end we used Handlebars.js + Bulma CDN and Insomnia to test our code. Javascript and Node.js were crucial tools as well.
         And our most important ingredient - Memebook was built with love<3
